# ConvToVTK

## Function 

This program is a simple utility to 

1. convert Gambit Neutral Mesh Files to VTK based files (VTU: Unstructured Grid / VTP: Polydata)
2. convert P1 mesh to P2 mesh
2. convert `.msh` file generated by GMSH to VTK based files.

Meshes generated are compatible with [svFSI](https://github.com/SimVascular/svFSI).

## How to use

There are four examples included here.

1. Convert Gambit Neutral Mesh Files
   ```bash
   ../bin/conv_msh2vtk.exe lumen_cyl_quad2D.neu
   ```

2. Convert VTK-format P1 mesh to P2 mesh
   ```bash
   ../bin/conv_msh2vtk.exe P1-to-P2.dat
   ```
   
3. Convert Text-format P1 mesh to P2 mesh
   ```bash
   ../bin/conv_msh2vtk.exe Text-to-P2.dat
   ```

4. Convert GMSH file to VTK mesh
   ```bash
   ../bin/conv_msh2vtk.exe gmsh_flow_past_cylinder.msh
   ```

The output body mesh is named `mesh-complete.mesh.vtu`, and all the boundary meshes are stored in `./mesh-surfaces`.
